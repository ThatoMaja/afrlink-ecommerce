<h1>📰 The AfriLink Blog</h1>

<div class="blog-post">
  <h2>What is AfriLink?</h2>
  <p>
    AfriLink is a proudly South African online marketplace designed for real people — from township hustlers to university side hustles to full-blown small businesses. We’re building a bridge between buyers and sellers that’s simple, local, and secure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our platform empowers anyone to create a store, sell products and earn income online — without all the red tape or hidden fees.
  </p>

<div class="blog-post">
  <h2>Why We Started This</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s be real — South Africa needs more tech that understands us. We were tired of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>International platforms that don't support local delivery</li>
    <li>High selling fees and low trust</li>
    <li>Complex sites that feel like you need a degree to use them</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    So, we built AfriLink — a platform where anyone can list, buy and thrive online.
  </p>
